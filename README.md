Tutorial for Git

CS Student looking to upload and share my coding adventures. 
Will include detailed readme's in order to document my development as a programmer.
I look forward to sharing my code with others 
and potentially helping anyone in the future who might experience the same problems as I have. 
Happy Coding. 

This commit is also just a tutorial on how to use git and to push commits, branching, etc.
